Sea Base Omega is currently a bunch of hacked together code to draw a pretty picture.

What it's meant to be is a 2D tile-based underwater atmospheric simulation with a game tacked on.
Like Space Station 13, but underwater.

Libraries required to build:
- SDL 1.2 - http://libsdl.org/
- Lua 5.1 - http://lua.org/

Libraries soon to be required:
- ENet - http://enet.bespin.org/

I *was* going to use Squirrel but then I found that it kinda sucked, so I'm going with Lua.

SDL 2.0 support should be coming soon.

Unlike Iceball, there will be no TCP-based protocol, just an ENet one. Having to write that TCP stuff all over again would just be a total waste of time.

This engine is not expected to be as flexible as Iceball's, as I need to ensure that the atmos sim runs quickly.
